Deployed Link: [https://chatsphereclient.netlify.app](https://chatsphereclient.netlify.app)

## Key Features

1. **Direct Chat**: Users can engage in one-on-one conversations with other users in real-time. The chat feature supports text-based messages, allowing users to have private conversations.

2. **Group Chat**: ChatSphere also enables users to create and participate in group chats. Multiple users can join a group chat and exchange messages simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and team communication.

3. **Online/Offline Presence**: Users' online or offline status is displayed in real-time, giving other users visibility into their availability for conversation.

4. **Typing Indicator**: ChatSphere incorporates a typing indicator feature that displays when a user is currently typing a message. This real-time feedback enhances the overall chat experience, making conversations more fluid and responsive.

5. **Chat Notifications**: Users receive notifications for new messages, friend invitations, and other relevant events. This feature ensures that users stay informed and can promptly respond to incoming messages.

6. **File Sharing**: ChatSphere leverages Firebase's file storage capabilities, allowing users to share files with each other during conversations. Users can easily upload and download files, enhancing collaboration and information exchange.

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
